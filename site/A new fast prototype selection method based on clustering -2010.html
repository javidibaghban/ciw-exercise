				A new fast prototype selection method based on clustering -2010 :<br />
			</p>
			<p> 
				Abstract In supervised classiﬁcation, a training set T is
given to a classiﬁer for classifying new prototypes. In
practice, not all information in T is useful for classiﬁers,
therefore, it is convenient to discard irrelevant prototypes
from T. This process is known as prototype selection,
which is an important task for classiﬁers since through this
process the time for classiﬁcation or training could be
reduced. In this work, we propose a new fast prototype
selection method for large datasets, based on clustering,
which selects border prototypes and some interior prototypes.
Experimental results showing the performance of
our method and comparing accuracy and runtimes against
other prototype selection methods are reported.
