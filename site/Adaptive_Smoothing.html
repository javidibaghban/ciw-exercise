				Adaptive smoothing in kernel discriminant analysis ANIL K. GHOSH  and SUBHADIP BANDYOPADHYAY Center for Mathematics and its Applications, Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia Faculty of Applied Mathematics, Institute of Armament Technology, Girinagar, Simhagad Road, Pune 411025, India (Received in final form 3 March 2006) One popular application of kernel density estimation is in kernel discriminant analysis, where kernel estimates of population densities are plugged in the Bayes rule to develop a nonparametric classifier. Performance of these kernel density estimates and that of the corresponding classifier depends on the values of associated smoothing parameters commonly known as the bandwidths. Bandwidths that minimize mean integrated square errors of kernel density estimates often lead to poor misclassification rates in classification problems. In discriminant analysis, usually a cross-validated estimate of misclassification probability is minimized to find the optimal bandwidth, and that bandwidth is used for classifying all observations. However, in addition to depending on the training data set, a good choice of bandwidth should also depend on the specific observation to be classi?ed. Therefore, instead of fixing the value of the bandwidth parameter, in practice it may be more useful to choose it adaptively. This article presents one such adaptive classification technique, where the bandwidth is chosen on the basis of the training sample and the data point to be classified. The performance of the proposed method has been illustrated using some benchmark data sets.
